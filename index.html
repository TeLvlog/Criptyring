                                    Further headway has been made in Xinjiang’s opening up to the outside world. Xinjiang's unique geographical location and the land border line that accounts for 1/4 of the country provide superior conditions for Xinjiang to open up to the outside world.
                                    The "One Port, Two Districts, Five Centers and Port Economic Belt" is an important step for Xinjiang to implement the Belt and Road Initiative and promote the construction of the core area on the westward passageway.
